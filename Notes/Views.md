## Views :-

In SQL, a view is a virtual table based on the result set of a SQL query. Unlike a physical table, a view does not store data itself; instead, it provides a way to look at data from one or more tables. Views can be used to simplify complex queries, enhance security by limiting access to certain data, and present data in a specific format or structure.


### Views operation:-
- Creating a View
- Querying a View
- Updating a View
- Dropping a View

## Key Characteristics of Views :-
- **Virtual Table:** A view is a stored query that creates a virtual table, which can be queried like a regular table.
- **No Data Storage:** Views do not store data physically; they dynamically retrieve data from the underlying tables whenever accessed.
- **Simplify Complex Queries:** Views can encapsulate complex queries, making it easier to use and understand.
- **Security:** Views can limit user access to specific rows or columns, providing a layer of security by restricting direct access to the   underlying tables.
- **Updateable Views**: Some views are updatable, meaning you can insert, update, or delete rows through the view, but with certain limitations.

## purpose of view

The purpose of a **view** in SQL is to simplify how you interact with data. Think of a view as a "virtual table" that shows specific data from one or more real tables, without storing the data itself. Here's a breakdown of its main purposes:

1. **Simplify Complex Queries**: Views can combine multiple tables or apply filters, making it easier to retrieve and work with data.
   
2. **Enhance Security**: Views can limit access to sensitive data by only showing certain columns or rows, so users can see what they need without accessing the entire table.
   
3. **Provide Consistent Data Format**: Views can present data in a specific format or structure, useful for reporting or analysis.
   
4. **Decouple Database Structure**: If the underlying table structure changes, you can update the view without affecting the queries that rely on it.

In essence, a view makes your interaction with the database simpler, safer, and more efficient.

## Creating a View:

Creating a view in SQL involves defining a virtual table based on the result set of a SQL query. The view is then stored in the database, allowing you to query it just like a regular table.

**Syntax**:
```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

### Step-by-Step Example
Suppose you have a table named `employees` with the following columns:
- *employee_id*
- *first_name*
- *last_name*
- *salary*
- *department_id*

You want to create a view that shows only the `employee_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, and `salary` for employees who earn more than $60,000.


### **Step 1: Define the SQL Query**

First, write the SQL query that retrieves the data you want to include in the view:

**Example**:

```sql
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 60000;
```

### **Step 2: Create the View**
Now, use the CREATE VIEW statement to create the view based on the query:


**Example**:

```sql
CREATE VIEW high_earners AS
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 60000;
```



### **Step 3: Using the View**
After the view is created, you can query it just like a regular table:

**Example**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM high_earners;
```

### **Result:**

This will return a list of employees from the employees table who earn more than $60,000, showing only the employee_id, first_name, last_name, and salary.


| employee_id | first_name | last_name | salary |
|-------------|------------|-----------|--------|
| 101         | Sanika     | Bhor      | 68900  |
| 109         | Sumit      | Bhor      | 75000  |
| 131         | Disha      | Satpute   | 67000  |

## Querying a View:

Querying a view in SQL is just like querying a regular table. Once a view is created, you can retrieve data from it using the SELECT statement. Hereâ€™s how you can do. it

**Syntax**:
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM view_name
WHERE condition;
```

### Example 1: Basic Query

Suppose you have a view named high_earners that was created to show employees who earn more than $60,000. You can query this view to get the data:

**Example**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM high_earners;
```

**Explanation:**

- This query selects all columns and rows from the high_earners view.

### Example 2: Filtering Data from a View

You can also apply additional filters to the data retrieved from a view, just as you would with a table:

**Example**:
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM high_earners
WHERE salary > 80000;
```

**Explanation:**

- This query selects the first_name and last_name of employees from the high_earners view who have a salary greater than $80,000.


### Example 3: Sorting Data from a View
You can order the results retrieved from a view:

**Example**:
```sql
SELECT employee_id, first_name, salary
FROM high_earners
ORDER BY salary DESC;
```

**Explanation:**

- This query selects the employee_id, first_name, and salary from the high_earners view and orders the results by salary in descending order.


### Example 4: Aggregating Data from a View
You can perform aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc., on data from a view:

**Example**:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_high_earners
FROM high_earners;
```

**Explanation:**

- This query counts the number of rows in the high_earners view, giving the total number of employees who earn more than $60,000.

## Updating a View:

Updating a view in SQL refers to modifying the definition of an existing view. This can be done using the CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW statement. It allows you to change the structure, columns, or logic of the view without needing to drop and recreate it.

**Syntax**:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```


### Example:

Updating a view in SQL refers to modifying the definition of an existing view. This can be done using the CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW statement. It allows you to change the structure, columns, or logic of the view without needing to drop and recreate it.

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW high_earners AS
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 60000;
```
Now, you want to update this view to also include the department_id column and change the salary condition to only show employees who earn more than $70,000.

**Use CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW high_earners AS
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, salary, department_id
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 70000;
```

**Explanation:**

- The CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW statement updates the existing high_earners view to include the department_id and filter for employees with salaries above $70,000.
- The view now reflects the new logic without needing to drop and recreate it.
