## * RDBMS :-
- RDBMS stands for relational database management system.
- The Relational model stores data in the form of tables. This concept is introduced by Dr. E. F. Codd, a researcher of IBM. The model is thr first choice of commercial data processing application for storing the  data.
- Relational model is most famous because of its simplest structure as compare to other database models like nettwork or hierarchicacl model.
- The relational model is now consider as primary model of database.
- The relational data model is the simple model having all the properties reeqired to process data.
- A relational database is an atttempt to simplify the data structure by making use of tables. Table are used to represent the data and their relationship. Table is a collection of rows and columns. table are also known as relations.

## * Advantages of Relational model :-
  ↪ Ease of use
  
  ↪ Flexibility
  
  ↪ Security

  ↪ Data Independance

  ↪ Data Manipulation Language

## * Types of RDBMS SOftware :-

  ↪ **Oracle**
  - Oracle database is most widely used object-relational database management software.
  - it suport multiple versions of windows, unix and linux OSs.
  - It is secured, occupies less space, supports large databases, reduces CPU time to process data. 
  
  ↪ **MS-Access**
  - MS-Access combines relational database engine with GUI and softwarer development tools.
  - MS-Access stores data in its format.
  - It allows user to store, reteieve and manipulate the database. 
  
  ↪ **SQL Server**
  - SQL Server is a product of RDBMS mainly developed for storing and retriving data to be used by application as per their need.
  - It extends standard SQL by enhancing features like transaction control, error handling etc.
  - As a central database, it can also be stored on derver machine.

  ↪ **MySql**
  - MySql is an orcle-backed open source relational darabase management system (RDBMS) based on Structured Query Language (SQL).
  - MySql runs on virtually all platforms, inicluding Linux, Unix and Windows. Although it can be used in a wide range of application, MySql  is most often associated with web applications and online publishing.

## * Characteristics of relational Database :-

1. **Table-Based Structure**:Data is organized into tables (rows and columns), making it easy to visualize and manage.
2. **Relationships**: Tables can be linked using keys (primary and foreign keys) to represent relationships between different sets of data.
3. **SQL Queries**: Uses Structured Query Language (SQL) for querying and managing data, allowing for complex data operations with simple commands.
4. **Data Integrity**: Enforces data accuracy and consistency through constraints like unique keys, primary keys, and foreign keys.
5. **Scalability**: Can handle large amounts of data and complex queries, making it suitable for small and large applications.

## * Basic RDBMS Terminalogy :-
- ### Database:

  Database is considerd as collection of tables.
 
- ### Relation (Table):

  It is a collection of rows and column, where records represented by rows and attributes represented by columns.

- ### Tuple (Records):

  Tuple is a single row of the table. it containa whole record of a particular data item.

- ### Attribute (Field):

  It is a column of a table. For example: in student table roll_no, name, age, marks are the attributes of the table.
